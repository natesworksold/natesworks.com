title: Introducing SwiftOS
description: A GNU/Linux distribution 
date: 2024-06-08

SwiftOS is a GNU/Linux distribution made from scratch. It uses the Simple Desktop Display Manager ([SDDM](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/SDDM)) and [KDE Plasma 6](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/) desktop environment. Both SDDM and KDE use the default breeze theme, but it can be easily changed. It uses the [SystemV](https://pl.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_V) init system and [birdy](https://github.com/swiftosproject/birdy-rust-frontend) package manager. Birdy allows you to download packages from our official servers and third-party servers. For updates join our [discord](https://discord.com/invite/2DEmQnQMwx).
