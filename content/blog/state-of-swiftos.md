description: An update of the current state of SwiftOS

SwiftOS is currently chrootable, allowing users to access its environment. However, it cannot yet be booted into due to a bug with ncurses. We're working to fix this issue and anticipate achieving bootability by June 18th. Our goal is to have the full desktop environment operational by June 25th. Any updates to these timelines will be shared through here and our discord https://discord.gg/36w5MrNePT. Birdy is currently being rewritten by Oreo.
