description: SwiftOS development restarted again

SwiftOS development has been restarted once again for multiple reasons. The biggest one is due to problems with multiple libraries "succesfully" compiling, but other packages depending on it saying it's corrupted. Recompiling didn't work and after an hour of debugging I decided to restart development.
